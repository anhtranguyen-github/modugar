🌑 The Lore of Viremyr, the Withered World
Long ago, before time bloomed and withered, there was only the Verdant Flame, an eternal life-force that danced in the heart of the Eonspire, a colossal tree so vast its branches cradled moons, and its roots strangled stars.

From this Flame came Ael’Thir, the Dawnborne Sovereign, who first shaped the land of Viremyr—a world of splendor and sorrow. Ael’Thir birthed the first beings: The Verdali, ageless caretakers of life and memory, woven from bark, bone, and celestial fire.

But peace is a fragile bloom.

🩸 The Fracture of Sovereignty
Ael’Thir, desiring to anchor eternity, kindled the Heartroot Pact, a covenant binding the Verdant Flame to Viremyr. Yet, in defying the natural cycle, the Flame grew restless. It birthed its opposite: the Witherblight, a creeping death-force, cold and calculating.

From this blight rose Mournhal, the Ash-Graced, a fallen Verdali who saw death not as curse, but as truth. Gathering broken gods and cursed kin, Mournhal forged the Thornsong Court, and with them, shattered the Heartroot Pact.

Ael’Thir vanished, the Verdant Flame flickered... and Viremyr decayed.

🌫️ The Age of Hollow Bloom
Centuries passed. The Eonspire withered, the sky cracked with Bleedlight, and the lands became a Woundscape, where time loops, memories rot, and the dead dream.

In this dying world, the Flame remains—dormant, buried beneath the Griefspire Cradle, guarded by the remnants of the Verdali, now hollow and mad. Prophecy speaks of a Kindleshade, one who walks between rot and renewal, neither Verdali nor Blightborne.

They are the last hope to rekindle the Verdant Flame—or extinguish it forever.

🕯️ Factions of the Fading Realm
The Emberleaf Covenant: Pilgrims of hope who believe the Flame must be rekindled. Led by Sister Halessyn, a blind seer who bleeds molten sap.

The Thornsong Court: Ruled by King Mournhal, who speaks through weeping roots. They seek to erase the Flame and let the world crumble into perfect stillness.

The Briarborn Exiles: Broken Verdali turned beasts, they roam the land as memories made flesh, seeking their forgotten names.

The Gilded Unveiled: A secretive order of mask-wearers who harvest dream-embers from the dying, believing the true Flame lies in illusion.

🔥 The Player’s Role
You are the Kindleshade, born of ash and root, emerging at the edge of the world with one spark of the Verdant Flame embedded in your soul. Every choice you make shapes the fate of Viremyr.

Will you...

Rekindle the Flame and bind life once more?

Snuff it out and usher in eternal silence?

Or become something else—a new god of rot, fire, and ruin?
