Centuries passed. The Eonspire withered, the sky cracked with Bleedlight, and the lands became a Woundscape, where time loops, memories rot, and the dead dream.
Chunk: 14
High Relevancy: 0.46
In this dying world, the Flame remains‚Äîdormant, buried beneath the Griefspire Cradle, guarded by the remnants of the Verdali, now hollow and mad. Prophecy speaks of a Kindleshade, one who walks
